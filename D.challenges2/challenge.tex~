\begin{abstract}
In \cite{linslinschallenge2013} we posed some questions for which we had no answers
about homeomorphisms between closed orientable 3-manifolds. The two pairs of 3-manifolds
were the only uncertainties that were left in L. Lins Thesis under my supervision in the 
realm of 3-manifolds being induced by blackboard framed links up to 9 crossings (9-small 3-manifolds).
The paper was taken seriously by a few researchers that very quick could solve them.
The solution shows that the BLINK program of L. Lins does a complete job in
topologically classifying the 9-small 3-manifolds. In this paper I put some new challenge
that seem

This paper poses some basic questions about instances (hard to find) of 
a special problem in 3-manifold topology.
``Important though the general concepts and propositions may be with the 
modern industrious passion
for axiomatizing and generalizing has presented us \ldots nevertheless I am convinced that
the special problems in all their complexity constitute the stock and the core of mathematics; 
and to master their difficulty requires on the whole the harder labor.'' Hermann Weyl 1885-1955, 
cited in the preface of the first edition (1939) of \cite{whitehead1997}.

\section{A doubt in the classification of 3-manifolds: $U[1466]$ and $U[1563]$}

The objective of this note is to pinpoint an aspect of the classification of 
3-manifolds which is very important and has been essentially neglected in
the last 35 years of successes with the work of W. Thurston, G. Perelman,
I. Agol and many others. In despite of enormous progress, the 
classification problem remains, to our eyes, very difficult. The aspect we want to pinpoint is
asking basic questions on hard to find tough instances of the general theory.

framed links followed by the canonical Dehn fillings homeomorphic, or not?}
\label{fig:firstdoubtA}
\end{center}
\end{figure}



In a fundamental paper W. B. R. Lickorish proves that each closed orientable 
3-manifold can be encoded as a link in $\mathbb{S}^ 3$ with integers in 1-1 correspondence
with its components, \cite{lickorish1962representation}, the so called {\em framed links}.

Consider the two closed orientable 3-manifolds
obtained from surgery and canonical Dehn fillings on the 2-component
blackboard framed \cite{kauffman1991knots} link of Fig. \ref{fig:firstdoubtA}. 
Both are homology spheres, so their fundamental groups are perfect.
SnapPea \cite{weeks2001snappea} tells us, according to S. Matveev \cite{matveev2008},
that they are both hyperbolic and 
have the same volume up to 10 decimal places,. Moreover,
their Witten-Reshetiken-Turaev invariants with 10 decimal places 
agree up to $r=12$, \cite{lins2007blink}. These facts seem to imply that the manifolds are homeomorphic.
However, computations based on the methodology of 
\cite{lins2007blink} and \cite{lins1995gca}, which were up to this point successful
in finding homeomorphism between pairs of 3-manifolds, appear to fail for the first time.
Our bet is that the methodology does not fail, that is, the manifolds are not homeomorphic.
In the last 5 years we have asked the help of 
various distinguished topologists in trying to settle
this example. None of them succeeded in answering our question. So,
we believe the time is ripe to bring our doubt to the broader community 
of mathematicians
dealing with 3-manifolds and/or combinatorial group theory. 
This example corresponds to
the pair of blackboard framed links $U[1466]$ and $U[1563]$ 
of \cite{lins2007blink}. The numbers attached to the components (framing) 
coincide with their self-writhes in the given projection and, so, can be discarded.
Note that by introducing an appropriate number of positive or negative curls we can obtain
any framed link as a blackboard framed link (and discard the framings). In a blackboard framed
link we do not need nor use the framing to obtain a presentation of the fundamental group.

If the manifolds being compared are hyperbolic, then 
the difficult topological question of homeomorphism between the manifolds transforms
into the possibly equally difficult algebraic question of
isomorphism between their fundamental groups. So, as long as the general associated
question is not settled,
we have replaced a problem which we do not know how to solve into another,
which we also do not know how to solve. This might be, in some aspects,
progress, but hardly a definitive one.
In general, how to prove that the fundamental groups of hyperbolic 3-manifolds
are not isomorphic? Start by proving that there is no isomorphism between the 
fundamental groups of the above 3-manifolds. Or find one.

\section{Another doubt: $U[2125]$ and $U[2165]$}

It is important also to distinguish the pair 3-manifolds induced by the blackboard framed links of
Fig. \ref{fig:seconddoubtA}. 
\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{1.figs/T15_19.pdf}
\caption{\sf Are the closed orientable 3-manifolds obtained from surgery on $\mathbb{S}^3$ of the above

\label{fig:T15_19}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
As the previous pair, they are closed hyperbolic homology spheres and their WRT-invariants
agree up to $r=12$ with 10 decimal places, \cite{lins2007blink}.
The presentations for the fundamental groups of the manifolds $M^3[2125]$ and $M^3[2165]$
are:\\

\begin{center}
$\pi_1[2125]=\langle \{t_{ab}, t_{bc}, t_{cd}, t_{de},t_{ef}, t_{fa}, t_{gh}, t_{hi}, t_{ig},a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i\},$\\
$\{t_{ab}=h^{-1}, t_{bc}=d, t_{cd}=g^{-1}, t_{de}=b, t_{ef}=a, t_{fa}=i,$\\
$t_{gh}=c^{-1}, t_{hi}=f, t_{ig}=e^{-1},$\\ 
$t_{ab}t_{bc}t_{cd}t_{de}t_{ef}t_{fa}=1, t_{gh}t_{hi}t_{ig}=1,$\\
$bh=ha,bd=dc,dg=gc,db=be,ea=af,fi=ia,hc=cg,hf=fi,ge=ei\} \rangle,$
\end{center}

\begin{center}
$\pi_1[2165]=\langle \{t_{jk},t_{kl},t_{lm},t_{mn},t_{no},t_{oj},t_{pq},t_{qr},t_{rp},j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r\},$\\
$\{t_{jk}=r^{-1},t_{kl}=q,t_{lm}=j^{-1},t_{mn}=k,t_{no}=p^{-1},t_{oj}=l^{-1}, $\\
$t_{pq}=n^{-1},t_{qr}=m,t_{rp}=o^{-1}, $\\
$t_{jk}t_{kl}t_{lm}t_{mn}t_{no}t_{oj}=1,t_{pq}t_{qr}t_{rp}=1,$\\
$\{kr=rj,kq=ql,mj=jl,mk=kn,op=pn,jl=lo,qn=np,qm=mr,po=or\} \rangle.$
\end{center}

These are read directly from Fig. \ref{fig:T15_22}, in a way similar to the previous pair
of links.

\section{A more general question: the $hgqi_u^d$-classes of 3-manifolds}
The 3-manifolds of \cite{lins2007blink} are classified by homology and the quantum WRT$_r$-invariants
$r=3,\ldots,u$, up to $d$ decimal digits forming $hgqi_u^d$-classes. Our algorithm for computing the 
$WRT_r^d$-invariants are based on the theory developed in \cite{kauffman1994tlr}. 
The actual values rely on independent implementations
which coincide throughout \cite{kauffman1994tlr} and \cite{lins2007blink}.
The main domain 
of links in \cite{lins2007blink} (there are others) is formed by the so called {\em representative g-blinks},
$U[p]$'s $p=1,2,\ldots,$ which is a highly filtered class of blackboard framed links indexed by lexicography.
An important result of the work is that the $U[p]$'s form a universal class of 3-manifolds, in the sense 
that no closed orientable 3-manifold is missing. The examples of the previous 
section embed into two $hgqi_{12}$-classes:
$9_{126}$ (page 201 of  \cite{lins2007blink}) and $9_{199}$ (page 213 of \cite{lins2007blink}). 
The $hgqi_{12}^{10}$-class
$9_{126}$ is formed by 5 links $U[1466], U[1563], U[1738], U[2233]$ and $U[2866]$. 
The $hgqi_{12}^{10}$-class $9_{199}$ is formed by 3 links: $U[2125], U[2165]$ and $U[3089]$.
In Fig. \ref{fig:nine126nine199}, we display $9_{126}$ and $9_{199}$.
This note's final challenge is to classify topologically $9_{126}$ and $9_{199},$ in the sense
given in the caption of Fig. \ref {fig:nine126nine199}.

% \section{Conclusion}
% A closed orientable 3-manifold is denoted {\em $n$-small} if it is induced by surgery on
% a blackboard framed link with at most $n$ crossings.
% Our bet is that both pairs of 3-manifolds in the 2 first sections of 
% this short note are not homeomorphic. This would mean that the $9$-small manifolds are
% completely classified and that
% the combinatorial dynamics of Chapter 4 in \cite{lins1995gca} based 
% on $TS$-moves which leads to a  (small, in the case of hyperbolic 3-manifolds)
% number of minimal gems, named the {\em attractor of
% the 3-manifold} is successful. This induces an efficient algorithm which 
% is capable of classifying topologically all the 3-manifolds given as a blackboard framed link
% with up to (so far) 9 crossings and maintains live the two Conjectures of page 15 of \cite{lins1995gca}:
% the $TS$- and $u^n$-moves yield an efficient algorithm
% to classify $n$-small 3-manifolds by explicitly displaying homeomorphisms, whenever they exist.
