% \section{Conclusion}
% A closed orientable 3-manifold is denoted {\em $n$-small} if it is induced by surgery on
% a blackboard framed link with at most $n$ crossings.
% Our bet is that both pairs of 3-manifolds in the 2 first sections of 
% this short note are not homeomorphic. This would mean that the $9$-small manifolds are
% completely classified and that
% the combinatorial dynamics of Chapter 4 in \cite{lins1995gca} based 
% on $TS$-moves which leads to a  (small, in the case of hyperbolic 3-manifolds)
% number of minimal gems, named the {\em attractor of
% the 3-manifold} is successful. This induces an efficient algorithm which 
% is capable of classifying topologically all the 3-manifolds given as a blackboard framed link
% with up to (so far) 9 crossings and maintains live the two Conjectures of page 15 of \cite{lins1995gca}:
% the $TS$- and $u^n$-moves yield an efficient algorithm
% to classify $n$-small 3-manifolds by explicitly displaying homeomorphisms, whenever they exist.

\section{A concluding remark}
By the way, the elegant drawings of blinks and blackboard framed links produced by BLINK are 
possible due the groundbreaking algorithm of R. Tamasia \cite{tamassia1987egg}.
Lauro could implement the drawings very fast because we had at hand the implementation of
network flow algorithms he had done for a project to solve timetable problems.
This is an example of the unicity in Mathematics, advocated by L. Lovasz in his famous essay \cite{lovasz1998om}.
To get the drawings one has apply three times the full strength of network flow theory.
The drawings BLINK presents are in an integer grid and 
deterministically minimize the number of $\pi/2$-bents in the blackboarded framed links.
In particular, it permit us to deal with the unavoidable curls which adjust the integer framing.
The drawings for the companion blinks are a slight modification: it replaces each $p$-valent vertex $p>4$,
by a $p$-polygon inducing 3-valent ones. The final result is massaged a bit to
produce aesthetically nice and unambiguous drawings.
