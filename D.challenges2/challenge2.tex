This paper poses some basic questions about instances (hard to find) of 
a special problem in 3-manifold topology.
``Important though the general concepts and propositions may be with the 
modern industrious passion
for axiomatizing and generalizing has presented us \ldots nevertheless I am convinced that
the special problems in all their complexity constitute the stock and the core of mathematics; 
and to master their difficulty requires on the whole the harder labor.'' Hermann Weyl 1885-1955, 
cited in the preface of the first edition (1939) of A. N. Whitehead's book
{\em The classical groups: their invariants and representations} \cite{whitehead1997}.

In this paper I focus on new uncertainties left unanswered in L. Lins thesis \cite{lins2007blink}
on the homemorphism problem of eleven concrete pairs of closed orientable 3-manifolds induced
by 3-connected monochromatic {\em blinks} (\cite{kauffman1994tlr}). The eleven HG8QI-classes are the 
only doubts left in the thesis, but the first two of them were solved few days ago and 
in this work I report on their solutions.

\section{Introduction}
In a joint recent paper posted recently in the arXiv (\cite{linslinschallenge2013}) 
my son Lauro Lins and myself ask some 6 years old questions for which we had no answers
about homeomorphisms between closed orientable 3-manifolds. The two pairs of 3-manifolds
were the only uncertainties that were left in L. Lins thesis  
(\cite{lins2007blink}) under my supervision in the 
domain of 3-manifolds being induced by monochromatic blinks
up to 9 edges (9-small 3-manifolds).
A subset of relevant 10-crossings blinks were generated but their topological classification remains untouched.
The paper was taken seriously by a few researchers, among them M. Culler, N. Dunfield, C. Hodgson 
and others that could solve them very quickly using GAP (\cite{gap2002gap}), Sage (\cite{sage2012}) 
and SnapPy (\cite{snappy}), 
tools that (except for GAP) were basically unknown to us. 
The solutions were obtained by distinct methods and are all consistent (inclusive with BLINK, 
the program of L. Lins (implementing my theory described in \cite{lins1995gca}), which support his thesis). Together
with my colleague Cristiana Nascimento, here at CIn/UFPE, I am learning fast to operate these wonderful tools.
The solutions people found shows that BLINK does a complete job in
topologically classifying the 9-small 3-manifolds. 
This is the subject of a joint paper with Lauro, currently under preparation.


The first solution that I got, and that still blows my mind,  
was by Craig Hodgson using length spectra techniques, based in his
joint paper with J. Weeks entitled {\em Symmetries, 
isometries and length spectra of closed hyperbolic three-manifolds} 
(\cite{hodgson1994symmetries}). By using SnapPy Craig showed that even though the 
quantum WRT-invariants as well as the volumes of the 
hyperbolic $Z$-homology spheres induced by the bfl's,
$U[1466]$ and $U[1563]$ are the same, the length of the 
smallest geodesics of them are distinct. For the other pair of bfl's $U[2125]$ and $U[2165]$ he shows that 
precisely the same facts apply. Here is a summary of Craig's findings extracted from the SnapPy session
that he kindly sent me. As Craig writes: {\em ``The output of the length spectrum command shows the {\em complex lengths}
of closed geodesics --- the real part is the actual length and the imaginary part is the rotation angle
as you go once around the geodesic.''}\\
\begin{center}
\center{Class $9_{126}$:}

\end{verbatim}
\end{center}


I posted 4 versions of \cite{linslinschallenge2013} correcting annoying mistakes 
in the presentations of the fundamental groups, putting a second pair of links,  
and in focusing the challenge in a broader context.  
I computed the presentations manually and I had a hard time making them correct.
Even though the presentations are redundant because the blink is enough to 
define the 3-manifold, as explained in  \cite{kauffman1994tlr},
my objective was to facilitate the work for those wanting to use GAP.
The time spanned between the first (April 22, 2013) and the last version (May 1, 2013) 
was a little more than one week. 
During these revisions I was completely unaware that the paper had called the attention
of many people. I did not know that the blog on lower dimensional topology
was very active exposing my incorrections and I apologize for my ignorance. 
I thank Cristiana for having calling the blog to my attention. Worse, 
some people did not see the follow up versions.
This was the case of Nathan Dunfield who worked with the 
wrong presentations. Not without reason he was angry at me,
but I think that this is no longer true, since he was willing to answer my sometimes naives and stupid 
questions and send me a solution for the first pair of manifolds of the present work, 
using SnapPy, Sage and GAP computations, by working with covers. I did not know these tools.
But, when properly motivated, I can learn fast and in general I do believe 
that I have something important and different to say in this brave new world of
3-manifolds: see the wonderful essay of E. Klarreich published by the Simons Foundation (march 2012), 
\cite{Klarreich1012}. I have been putting a great amount of time and effort during my scientific carreer, 
(most of the time as an isolated researcher) on (mainly closed) 3-manifods. I seek no longer to be isolated: my team
is the World, my compromisse is with Truth (independently of whom first found it).

Marc Culler was very helpful in answering questions of myself and Cristiana and helping her about issues in the 
downloading and 
installing SnapPy and Sage and GAP in her machine. With the presentation incorrections out of the 
way he produced an independent proof of the distinctveness of $(U[1466, U[1563])$ and of 
$(U[2125, U[2165])$. He also produced instantaneous isomorphic triangulations of the homeomorphic
3-manifolds in the classes $9_{126}$ and $9_{199}$. This fact makes me anxious to compare and timing the 
performances of BLINK (which also produces instantaneous solutions
for the same problems) and SnapPy regarding 
finding homeomorphisms of $k$-small 3-manifolds, given that the 
homeomorphisms exist. 


\section{Objective of this work: help to make BLINK known}
In this paper I put some new challenges (also coming from
\cite{lins2007blink}), that seem harder than the ones considered in the 
previous paper. The reason I think so
is that going from 9 to 14,15,16 crossings in the links,
numerical problems start appearing concerning finding the Dirichlet domain and, in these cases, finding
isomorphic triangulations might be harder to SnapPy than to BLINK. At any rate I have hundreds of examples
where the performance of these programs in this issue could be compared, if anyone is seriously interested. Currently
BLINK is not documented and one of my objectives is to seek for help in doing it and extend its capability.
BLINK is hosted at Github under the userid {\em laurolins} and is open source code project. Unfortunately Lauro (currently
a researcher at AT\&T) does not have the necessary time to go on with the implementation. But he welcomes and 
is willing to help collaborators in getting started. 
As for myself, I am too old for the energy needed to construct good pieces of software. I intend to act
as one of some Scientific Supervisors for the deployment and for the discussions of the new algorithms  
to be included in BLINK, but only at the mathematical level. The technological and software engineering
screws and bolts needed, I leave to others. 


An algorithm that I want to attach to BLINK is finding a uniformly distributed random closed orientable 3-manifold induced 
by a blink with an arbitrary number (even thousands) of edges. I want to gather evidence 
for the truth of some important conjectures that depend on this
capability. Another example of such new algorithms that I want to include in BLINK is made possible by the theory 
in Ricardo Machado's thesis
under my supervision, defended in March, 2013. We got an $O(n^2)$-algorithm for going from a special kind of gem, 
named {\em resoluble gem}, to 
a blink inducing the same manifold. This work is available, in still rather sketch form (even the definition of 
resolubility is unecessary complicated), in the three joint papers
posted last year in the arXiv, {\cite {linsmachadoA2012, linsmachadoB2012, linsmachadoC2012}. The algorithm was
implemented in Mathematica, but it needs to be improved and re-implemented in Java or C++. 
We found a rather crude framed link presentation for
the hyperbolic dodecahedral space (Weber-Seifert manifold). As far as I know nobody has found such a
framed link. My interest in it was aroused by J. Weeks in a visit to the Geometry Center in April 1993, when he asked me whether
I had such framed link. The link inducing the Weber-Seifert 3-manifold is a 9-component link embedded 
into $\mathbb{R}^3$, with an integer attached to each component (its framing) 
and having a total of 68 (only) vertices with a projection having 142 crossings.
(It started with a PL-link with more than 600 vertices.)
In a fourth joint paper with R. Machado, currently under preparation,
we will show that every 3-manifold admits a resoluble gem inducing it.

\section{The eleven classes of tough 3-manifolds}
I assume that the reader has with him a copy of the version 4 of previous challenge paper 
(\cite{linslinschallenge2013}) 
and has learned how to read the manifold either from the blink  or
from the blackboard framed link, \cite{kauffman1994tlr}. As for obtaining a presentation
of the fundamental group based on the Wirtinger relators  (\cite{stillwell1993classical}) 
and the Dehn fillings (\cite{rolfsen2003knots})
the two detailed examples given in \cite{linslinschallenge2013} should suffice, if the reader
has not available other pieces of softwares to get the presentation by automatic means. 
Actually, the best way to enter these manifolds
is to draw the blackboard framed link using SnapPy and informing the $w$ of each component as
its self-writhe in the projection. The framing of that component to be informed to SnapPy is $(w,1)$.
Actually the first two classes are resolved, only remaining the nine final ones.
The complex numbers in polar form which appear at each $m^t_{p}$-class are the common 
quantum WRT-invariants. All except one of the eleven classes are formed by $Z$-homology spheres.
The exception is $16^t_{56}$ which has no torsion but Betti number 1. These facts are indicated 
by the small number in parenthesis (which  gives the homology of the manifold).

% \section{Conclusion}
% A closed orientable 3-manifold is denoted {\em $n$-small} if it is induced by surgery on
% a blackboard framed link with at most $n$ crossings.
% Our bet is that both pairs of 3-manifolds in the 2 first sections of 
% this short note are not homeomorphic. This would mean that the $9$-small manifolds are
% completely classified and that
% the combinatorial dynamics of Chapter 4 in \cite{lins1995gca} based 
% on $TS$-moves which leads to a  (small, in the case of hyperbolic 3-manifolds)
% number of minimal gems, named the {\em attractor of
% the 3-manifold} is successful. This induces an efficient algorithm which 
% is capable of classifying topologically all the 3-manifolds given as a blackboard framed link
% with up to (so far) 9 crossings and maintains live the two Conjectures of page 15 of \cite{lins1995gca}:
% the $TS$- and $u^n$-moves yield an efficient algorithm
% to classify $n$-small 3-manifolds by explicitly displaying homeomorphisms, whenever they exist.
